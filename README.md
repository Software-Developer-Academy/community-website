2. Navigate to the locally cloned repository by running: `cd community-website`
3. Install the project's dependencies by running: `npm install`

### Creating Your Member Profile
Now that you've joined the community, it's time to create your member profile on the site. To do this, edit the source code that's now
on your local machine to include your information. Once you've done so, create a "Pull Request" (also known as a PR) and request review
from one of the admins.
